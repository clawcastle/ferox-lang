# Primitive types
The language contains the following primitive types:

- Booleans (Either true or false)
- Numbers (Covers both integers and decimal numbers)
- Strings (They're, well, strings)
- Null (Named `Nil` in the book to avoid confusion with the native `null` type of Java or C, but since Rust has no concept of `null` I might as well use that name here)
